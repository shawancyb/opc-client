OPCDA.NET Client Sample Application
-----------------------------------

Copyright 2002-03 Advosol Inc.

This sample client uses many functions for browsing, read/write access and 
DataChanged callback handling. It can be used as sample of how the OPC server
functions can be used.


To compile the program you need to first add a reference to the OpcDaNet.DLL in
the OpcDaWrapper\bin directory.
Then the program can be compiled an run and used with any locally installed OPC server.
